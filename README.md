Application to allow competitive predictions of football scores.

The rules are based on the weekly bbc.co.uk article where Mark Lawrenson goes head-to-head with a different celebrity each week to predict the result of Premier League matches. A correct result is worth ONE point, while a correct score earns THREE points.

Players can create leagues in which they invite others to take part. Each league will focus on predicting results from a chosen set of competitions (eg Premier League, FA Cup). Each week, players will log in to see how they performed and to make their predections for the upcoming week.
